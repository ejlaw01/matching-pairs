# Matching Pairs

This is a coding exercise prompting a user to solve a simple word puzzle.

### _by Ethan Law_

## Description

Users follow the instructions to match each word on the right to it's most closely related counterpart on the left.  Clicking 'check' will cause correct answer fields to turn green with the incorrect fields turning red.  When all answers are correct, a banner will pop up congratulating the user.  Hitting 'reset' will remove the banner and pull a fresh set of words from the JSON.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3 with normalizer and Skeleton boilerplate
* JavaScript with jQuery and jQuery UI
